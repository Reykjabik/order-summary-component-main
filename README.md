## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

:iphone: **Mobile**

<img src='./images/mobile.png' alt='Mobile' height='600px'>

:desktop_computer: **Desktop**

![Desktop](./images/desktop.png)

I did not take screenshots of the hover states just not to mix all three hover changes into an image. I find it easier to notice the differences on the live site.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was fairly easy and I used it mostly to polish my SASS skills. I don't think I have learnt anything specific, but it helped me getting a bit more fluent using this preprocessor.

### Continued development

Now that I feel comfortable using the most basic features of SASS I am thinking of moving up in complexity. That is, functions and conditionals in SASS, for instance. Things that I have read and understood, but I have yet to put into practice.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I think I have used this link in every single one of my projects so far. A really good guide to **flexbox**.
- [SASS Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color) - This is probably one of the most interesting things I have learnt in this project, the functions `lighten` and `darken`.
